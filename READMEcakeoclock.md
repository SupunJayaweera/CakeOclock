We have decided to do a project for a Bakery System. Application will be developed in Blazor. And the corresponding mobile app will be built along with it. There, we are going to build a POS (point of sale) system for the items to be sold. Branches handle every pastry and cake order in his bakery. He has 7 branches. Each of the bakeries are run by its employees/ workers. 
We give them a web application along with a mobile application for their bakery and the branches to use. They will be allowed to notify the amount of pastry and cakes needed for each bakery on each day to the admin. Once the admin gets the notification/ message via the application, he will make necessary arrangements for the delivery of pastry items and cakes to his branches. Then he will confirm the amount of pastry items that he has provided for each bakery via the application. Additionally, once he has opened another branch somewhere, he can add it to the system easily. He just has to create a new user in the web application. Then the new branch can also use the applications. The signup process for new branches in the web application and the adding new pastry items and new cake items in the application will be CRUD operations.
